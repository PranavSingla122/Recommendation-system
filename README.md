An experiment is conducted in a class of approx. 150 students. In which students randomly interacted with each other and made a note of  those people whom they found impressive. This data is given to you as a csv file. First column stores the name  of person A and the remaining columns stores the names of those people who appeared impressive to person A. 

Now using data you have to find the 'Missing Links' i.e. if there is no edge between two nodes(which implies that they haven't met each other) then you have to predict that if they would have met, then what kind of edge would be there(both liked each other, one liked the other, didn't like each other).

As in this project you have to make predictions, predictions can be made by various methods.
